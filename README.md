# Banking System (JavaScript, Python, C#)

A terminal-based banking system implemented in three different programming languages: JavaScript, Python, and C#. Each language provides its own independent implementation of core banking features such as account creation, cash deposit and withdrawal, transaction history, and money transfers. This project is designed to compare implementations across languages and demonstrate key programming concepts.
